#+TITLE: Graphical Accuracy for SRMs QA Tool 

* Example usage

See [[file:examples/working_example.ipynb][example notebook]]

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC 
conda install anaconda
pip install -U git+https://github.com/wpk-nist-gov/grassy.git@develop
#+END_SRC

 - Note that the pip install doesn't handle requirements.  This is on purpose for now. 
The anaconda distribution has everything you need.  
 - The package should work with python 2.7 or 3.6


* TODO

 - Better matching of names (take a look at fuzzy matching https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13636848/is-it-possible-to-do-fuzzy-match-merge-with-python-pandas)
 
 - Nothing is done regarding Mass vs Volume right now.  Will incorporate soon.
